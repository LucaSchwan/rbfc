# Rust Brainfuck Compiler (and Interpreter)

My dream is to implement a selfhosted language for fun at some point. So this is my first endavour into writing a compiler.

For now it is just a simple interpreter that needs hard coded code and input.

It has a lexer as well as a parser and should give somewhat byte accurate error information.
